## Russian for Hindi speakers
## हिन्दी भाषियों के लिए रूसी अध्यन

### This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Although Hindi and Russian languages have many similarities, I noticed in the course of 
my learning Russian language that I could not find any resources for learning Russian 
in Hindi languages. 

English, as beautiful as it is, severely limits the structure of Russian because it 
does not have cases (कारक) as in Hindi or Sanskrit. For example, it is also difficult 
to explain the difference between _ты_ and _вы_ in English because there is only one 
pronoun _you_; as against Hindi which has तुम and आप; Spanish having _tu_ and _usted_.

Please feel free to contribute to this project. It is primarily written in XeLaTeX. 
Even if you don't know TeX but have ideas then you can either:
- Create a pull request in Libre, Word, text or any other editable format, and I will 
  convert it into TeX
- Contact me directly if you don't know or don't want to create a pull request, even 
  hand-written notes will be of great help!
- Contact me to help with corrections, provide any source material. Check spellings, 
  cross-referencing, editing, suggestions related to structure of the text.
  
### A few ground rules:
- Bibliography and reference citations are a _*must*_; if you are taking material from 
  any source. No Plagiarising!
- No copy-pasting (unless quoting directly), even if you are providing reference to your
  material, no copy-pasting of the material (copy-pasting means plagiarising)
  
That being said, this is a work in progress and while I am making every attempt to add 
bibliography and citations, it is possible that they are missed in a few places, I 
hope to correct them as I reach the final version.
